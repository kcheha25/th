Title (suggested)

Abstract (150–200 words)
One paragraph: scope, three fusion levels (data/pansharpening, feature, decision), methodology for literature selection, summary of contributions (taxonomy, benchmark matrix, recommended evaluation protocol, open problems).

1. Introduction (≈800–1,000 words)

Motivation & scope: define multimodal fusion and why organize by data-level (pansharpening), feature-level, decision-level.

2. Methodology for literature selection (≈300–500 words)

Search strategy (databases, keywords, time window), inclusion/exclusion criteria, number of papers reviewed per year.

Short paragraph on why IEEE ComSurv/Tutorials exemplar surveys were used as templates.

3. Background and problem formulation (≈700 words)

Notation and formal definitions for three fusion levels.

Brief recap of sensors/modalities (HSI, multispectral, panchromatic, LiDAR, SAR, camera, mmWave radar).

Common pre-processing steps (radiometric calibration, co-registration, atmospheric correction).

4. Taxonomy (single-page figure + 150–250 words)

Taxonomy figure: tree that splits by level of fusion → method families → learning vs model-based → single/multi-sensor scenarios.

5. Data-level fusion (Pansharpening / raw data fusion) (≈1,200–1,500 words)

5.1 Problem statement & mathematical model (observation models, forward model).

5.2 Classic model-based methods (IHS, Brovey, PCA, wavelet, component substitution) — concise equations, complexity.

5.3 Sparse-coding & unmixing approaches (dictionary learning, sparse reconstruction).

5.4 Learning-based deep pansharpening (CNNs, GANs, attention, 3D conv, transformer variants).

5.5 Evaluation metrics for pansharpening / spectral fidelity: SAM, ERGAS, SSIM, PSNR, RMSE — definitions and when to use each.

5.6 Benchmarks and datasets (recommendations + preproc rules).

5.7 Strengths, failure modes, open problems (spectral distortion, transferability, real-time constraints).

6. Feature-level fusion (≈1,200–1,500 words)

6.1 Formalization: feature extraction functions, alignment between feature spaces.

6.2 Handcrafted features (spectral indices, texture, morphological profiles) and concatenation strategies.

6.3 Statistical feature fusion (CCA, manifold alignment, joint subspace learning).

6.4 Deep feature fusion: Siamese/dual-branch, cross-modal attention, cross-modal transformers, multimodal contrastive learning.

6.5 Dimensionality reduction and feature selection (PCA, t-SNE/UMAP for analysis; wrapper/filter methods).

6.6 Evaluation metrics: downstream task metrics (classification OA/AA/Kappa, detection mAP), representation quality (cluster separability).

6.7 Strengths, limits, robustness to missing bands/modalities.

7. Decision-level fusion (≈900–1,200 words)

7.1 Definition and canonical frameworks (ensemble of classifiers, voting, stacking).

7.2 Probabilistic fusion: Bayesian model averaging, log-likelihood combination.

7.3 Evidence theory and belief fusion (Dempster-Shafer) for uncertain inputs.

7.4 Learning to fuse decisions: meta-learners, calibration, confidence-aware fusion.

7.5 Metrics: ROC/AUC, precision/recall, calibration error, robustness tests.

7.6 Use-cases where decision fusion is preferable (heterogeneous sensors, privacy constraints, lightweight nodes).

8. Cross-level & hybrid approaches (≈700 words)

Hierarchical pipelines (data → feature → decision), end-to-end joint learning vs modular design.

Sensor alignment, synchronization, cross-modal supervision, missing-modality handling.

Cross-level tradeoffs (performance vs interpretability vs deployability).

9. Comparative evaluation framework (core contribution) (≈800–1,000 words + tables)

Table 2: Comparative matrix — rows = representative methods (one per family), columns = criteria: spectral fidelity, spatial fidelity, task performance, computational cost, data needs, robustness, reproducibility.

Recommended experimental protocol: train/val/test splits, cross-scene generalization, simulation of missing modalities, ablation protocol.

Standard metrics per task (pansharpening / classification / detection / segmentation).

Reproducibility checklist (code, seeds, preproc, hardware).

10. Datasets & benchmarks (concise table + links)

Hyperspectral benchmarks: Indian Pines, Pavia University, Salinas, Kennedy Space Center — cite canonical sources.

Multimodal benchmarks (radar+camera / mmWave+camera): list available datasets used in COMST surveys (reference examples).

11. Practical deployment considerations (≈400–600 words)

Complexity, latency, memory, model compression, real-time constraints, on-board vs edge vs cloud.

Data privacy, sensor failure modes, calibration maintenance.

12. Open challenges & future research directions (≈700 words)

Standardization of benchmarks & metrics, robustness to domain shift, self-supervised multimodal pretraining, few-shot & continual learning, interpretability, physics-aware learning, real-time embedded fusion.

Short bullet list of 6–8 concrete open problems.

13. Conclusion (≈200–300 words)

One paragraph summary + one paragraph actionable recommendations for researchers (what to test first, what baselines to include).

Appendices (as needed)

Appendix A: Taxonomy figure & algorithm pseudocode.

Appendix B: Reproducible experiment scripts & parameter tables.

Appendix C: List of reference implementations and code repos.

Required figures / tables (must-have)

Taxonomy figure (fusion levels → method families).

Pipeline schematic(s) for each fusion level (data/feature/decision).

Table of representative algorithms with short descriptions and complexity.

Benchmark table: datasets, modalities, resolutions, typical tasks.

Comparative matrix (performance vs cost).

Sample result images (pansharpening visual comparison; classification maps).

Recommended article parameters for IEEE ComSurv

Target length: 12–18 journal pages (including figures), 8–12k words typical for comprehensive survey; follow COMST author guidelines.

Number of references: ≥150 (liberal citation policy; include historical and latest works).

Emphasize tutorial style and clarity for non-specialists.

Short justification — why this structure?

It mirrors successful COMST surveys that (i) present taxonomy, (ii) detail method families with equations and representative examples, (iii) supply extensive benchmark/metric recommendations and (iv) end with open challenges — see radar–camera and mmWave fusion surveys and recent hyperspectral COMST surveys.
